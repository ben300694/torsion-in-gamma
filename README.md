This is the Git-repository for publishing the
bachelor thesis and the SageMath code.

## Instructions

You will need [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/index.html) to run this program (version 7.2 or above is recommended).

The relevant SageMath code is contained in the directory `src/`.
Navigate there in your terminal, this directory should contain the file `main.sage`.

Now start SageMath in command line mode by typing `sage`,
then load the main file via `attach('main.sage')`.
