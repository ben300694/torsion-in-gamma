screen 
then start the process you want

For loading the correct sage version:
module switch sage/7.6

Press Ctrl-A then Ctrl-D. 
This will detach your screen session but leave your processes running.
You can now log out of the remote box.

If you want to come back later, log on again and type screen -r.
This will resume your screen session, and you can see the output of your process.
